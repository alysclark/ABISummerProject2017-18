DarcyEllipsoidPerm.py = script to build ellipsoid mesh with surface blood vessels and solve Darcy model for blood velocity throughout.
This code reads in porosity and permeability data from file kData.txt obtained from code written by Win Min Tun and uses this to solve for velocity. 

vFileConvert.py = script to convert output of DarcyEllipsoid.py to usable form (vData.txt) for adv-diff models.
