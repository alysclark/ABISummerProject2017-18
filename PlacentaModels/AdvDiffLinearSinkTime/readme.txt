Script to solve for a time-dependent linear-source advection diffusion model of Oxygen concentration in an ellipsoid placenta.
Surface blood vessels randomly seeded.

Capability of reading velocity information from text file (vData.txt) of form:
NODENUM, VCOMPONENT, VALUE
.
.
.

NOTE: This code is not functional yet, there are errors with compatibility between the velocity format being read in and the 
opencmiss methods for time-dependent solvers.
