Script to create mesh of ellipsoid with specified Volume, thickness and eccentricity (ellipticity) and seed node density number. 
The first seed n number is how many nodes are in a cube defined by the extremeties of the ellipsoid, actual number of nodes in 
ellipsoid mesh will be lower.

Script then solves for a laplace model of Oxygen concentration in an ellipsoid placenta.

Mesh with n-seed of 628000 is optimal.

Surface blood vessels BCs are randomly positioned. 

Example code output included in folder.
